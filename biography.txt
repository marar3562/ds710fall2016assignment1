Your first assignment is to use GitHub to submit some autobiographical information about yourself.  Answer the following questions.  Use GitHub to submit the resulting text file.
1. Rob Margherio
2. I currently live in Cedar Falls, Iowa working for John Deere as an engineer under the Large Tractor Product Test and Evaluation team. 
	I have been working with telematics data since 2013 at John Deere and have loved working in this fast growing field. 
	Machine data has lots of information hidden with it that can help our customers, dealers and our company save time and money. 
	I am hoping through this program to learn the software and concepts needed to help extract those insights within our ever growing data set.
3.  I used Matlab throughout college in multiple classes (two specifically for Matlab). 
	I have been using VBA and Python for a current project at work over the last 5 months. I am self-taught in these languages but 
	believe I am at a “Fair Understanding” level for Python and at a “Little Knowledge” level for VBA. The main coding I do on a day
	to day basis is within Aginity software writing custom SQL code. We use SQL to pull data in many different ways and create Tableau reports off
	of this information. I have been using SQL almost daily for 3.5 years now. 
4.  I took one class in college specifically around Statistics; however, other engineering courses did talk about basic statistics from time 
	to time. I use basic Statistics verbiage and calculations at work most days.  
5.  No other experiences other than what I noted above on Python.
6.  I hope to broaden my skills in Python coding. I know the basics but hope to learn how to do more advanced coding that can be used in 
	in my day to day job. I also look forward to learning the basics in R that will lead to understanding its statistical power
	for data science. 
7.  I look forward to the class and usually enjoy learning new coding languages and techniques!
